#Package Description:

Tweepy: Tweepy is a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. It makes it easy to authenticate and interact with the API using Python code. In this notebook, Tweepy is used to connect to the Twitter API, authenticate the user's credentials, and retrieve tweets from Twitter.

Pandas: Pandas is a popular data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions for working with structured data, such as data frames and series. In this notebook, Pandas is used to store the retrieved tweets in a data frame and perform data cleaning and manipulation operations on the data.

TextBlob: TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides functions for natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and noun phrase extraction. In this notebook, TextBlob is used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular plotting library for Python. It provides functions for creating a wide range of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts. In this notebook, Matplotlib is used to visualize the sentiment analysis results in the form of a bar chart.

Seaborn: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a higher-level interface for creating statistical visualizations. In this notebook, Seaborn is used to create a heatmap to visualize the frequency of the different sentiment labels in the data.

NumPy: NumPy is a library for working with arrays and numerical data in Python. It provides functions for performing mathematical operations on arrays, such as addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. In this notebook, NumPy is used to perform some numerical operations on the data.

WordCloud: WordCloud is a Python library for creating word clouds from text data. In this notebook, WordCloud is used to create a word cloud to visualize the most common words in the tweets.

NLTK: NLTK is a popular Python library for natural language processing tasks. It provides functions for tokenization, stemming, and other text preprocessing tasks. In this notebook, NLTK is used to perform tokenization and remove stop words from the tweets.






#Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This is a Jupyter notebook containing code for sentiment analysis on tweets using Python and Tweepy API. The aim of this project is to classify tweets into three categories - positive, negative, and neutral.

## To Run

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Tweepy API

##Installation
You can install Tweepy using pip:

```
pip install tweepy
You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip as well:

pip install jupyter
```
Usage
Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook file.

Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook.

Create a Twitter developer account to get access to the API keys and tokens.

Replace the placeholders in the code with your own API keys and tokens.

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

Once the code has finished executing, you will see the sentiment analysis results for the tweets.
